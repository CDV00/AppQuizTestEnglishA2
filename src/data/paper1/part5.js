Staff at the kart centre told Jann he drove so well, he might one day become a racing driver. Unfortunately, the kart centre closed soon afterwards, and there wasn’t another one near enough to his home that he could get to.",

Then, one day, when he was 18, he told them that he was one of the top ten winners of a computer racing competition. They were very surprised. His prize was to drive a real car in a race against the other nine top players.",
